🎨 DESIGN STRATEGY DELIVERED
=============================

1. COLOUR PALETTE (Beach-Themed)
   ─────────────────────────────
   • Ocean Blue (#0066CC) - Primary CTAs, headers, navigation
   • Sea Green (#00AA66) - Success states, eco-action highlights
   • Sand/Cream (#F5E6D3) - Background, subtle accents
   • Coral (#FF6B4A) - Alerts, urgent notifications
   • Dark Navy (#1A2A3A) - Body text, structure, contrast
   • Gold (#FFD700) - Badges, achievements, top rankings
   
   Rationale: Beach and ocean theme resonates with 18-24 year old eco-activists.
   Colors convey trust (blue), growth (green), and achievement (gold).

2. UX DESIGN PRINCIPLES
   ──────────────────────

   ✓ Location-Centric - Maps as primary interface
   ✓ Social Proof - Visible member counts, crew achievements
   ✓ Real-Time Data - Live weather & event info
   ✓ Mobile-First - Optimized for beach use (touchscreen)
   ✓ Gamification - Badges, leaderboards, crew rankings
   ✓ Accessibility - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard nav)

3. JAVASCRIPT FEATURES FOR INTERACTIVITY
   ──────────────────────────────────────
   ✓ Geolocation API - Auto-detect user location for nearby events
   ✓ Leaflet.js - Interactive maps with markers and popups
   ✓ LocalStorage API - Persist crew preferences & user data
   ✓ Fetch API + Async/Await - Weather data integration
   ✓ Event Delegation - Efficient DOM manipulation
   ✓ Modal System - Dynamic forms for crew creation & login
